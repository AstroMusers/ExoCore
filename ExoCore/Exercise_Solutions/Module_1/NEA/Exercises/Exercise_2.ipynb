    "*You are granted time on JWST's NIRCam in order to perform [transmission spectroscopy](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/03/Transmission_spectroscopy) on a [hot Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter). Your observation block is from August 15th - August 20th, 2025. Plan an observation for JWST using the [ephemeris](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TransitView/nph-visibletbls?dataset=transits) tool by finding a planet that meets the following criteria:*\n",
    "- $T_{eq} > 1500 \\; \\mathrm{K}$\n",
    "- $R_{p} > 1 \\; R_{J}$\n",
    "- $P < 10 \\; \\mathrm{Days}$\n",

    "*Additoinally, report the uncertainty in the transit time of your choice. Feel free to use the web interface or the Python API. Find the next feasible transit observation of your target.*"

    "A list of potentially viable candidates can be queried using `query_criteria(table='pscomppars', select='pl_name', where='pl_eqt>1500,pl_per<10,pl_radj>1')`. You can then use the ephemeris service to find which ones are able to be viewed by JWST in the given date range.\n",
