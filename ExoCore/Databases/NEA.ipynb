    "## Accessing Data\n",
    "### Browser-based Data Tables\n",
    "Most catalogs in the Exoplanet Archive are organized in interactive data tables. This section gives a brief overview of the important aspects of these tables, but a full user guide can be found [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/ICEexohelp.html).\n",
    "#### Data Columns\n",
    "An example of a few columns from the [Planetary Systems Composite Data catalog](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars) are shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_Table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When first accessing the page, a standard set of columns are shown, but many other data types are available that are not in the default view. The other available columns are located in the upper left in the \"Select Columns\" tab, which brings up this windowed control panel:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_Column.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives parameters of both the star and planet, the system as a whole, and other data (like light curves) associated with the planet. It is important to note that **not all entires will not have data for every column**. The data represents our current knowledge of these systems, so if the science has not been conducted, no data will be entered!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainties\n",
    "Columns with numerical data will often have uncertainties associated with an entry. Some have symmetric data in the form $x \\pm \\delta x$ and others are non-symmetric in the form $x^{+\\delta x_{1} }_{-\\delta x_{2}}$. These often arise due to different methodologies used in the source paper. Some entries do not report uncertainties at all, and it is up to the user to read the literature to assess the confidence of the stated value. Uncertainties are also provided in their own data columns, if they need to be separated for ease of parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering Methods\n",
    "The greatest advantage of the interactive data tables is the ability to **filter results**. This is done in the white box right below the column header, and the syntax for that data column is given by clicking on the red question mark. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_help.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are looking at a **floating number column**, and the syntax for the types of queries is shown. Thus, you are able to find entries that match a specific value, that do not include a specific value, are within a given limit (e.g. $<,>, \\leq, \\geq$) or within an inclusive range (e.g. $[x,y]$). There are two other column types: **integer** and **text**. Integer columns work identically to floating number columns. Text columns are a bit more limited, and only have three methods: substring match (e.g. contains this string), exclude substring, and a 'wildcard' feature using '%', allowing that character to mean any other character. Additionally, all columns use **null** and **not null** syntax, the former requiring the entry be empty and the latter requiring the entry to be not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downloading Tables\n",
    "A useful feature of the interactive data tables is the ability to download your selected and filtered data to an easily readable file. This is done by clicking the 'Download Table' tab next to the 'Select Columns' tab. It gives the following dropdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_COptions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file type selection can convert the data into commonly used data file types like CSV, VOTable, IPAC, and Tab-Separated values. Additionally, the table allows you to check individual rows and columns to be downloaded (only currently visible columns are considered 'checked'). For errors, the default is to append the errors next to the corresponding value in the same cell. To exclude this, the 'Values Only' option can be selected, to allow ease of parsing through the tables in external software. This does NOT exclude the error columns, so if you want the errors in a new column, they just need to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searchable Tables\n",
    "Some catalogs, such as the [K2 Target Catalog](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblSearch/nph-tblSearchInit?app=ExoTbls&config=k2targets) are too big to display in the above interactive format, or have visual elements (like the [Atmospheric Spectroscopy Table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/atmospheres/nph-firefly?atmospheres)) that need their own interface.

    "An alternative to the interactive data tables is the Table Access Protocol. A full explanation on how to use it and develop queries is found [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/TAP/usingTAP.html), as well as the catalog abbreviations. Below is a quick example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Queries\n",
    "The query format takes the following standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT <column list> FROM <table> WHERE <constraints> FORMAT <file format>```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `SELECT` and `FROM` conditions are mandatory. This uses the **standard base URL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync?query=```\n",
    "\n",
    "for web browsers, and if you use TOPCAT or pyVO clients:\n",
    "\n",
    "```https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you use the `select`, `from`, `where` and `format` syntax to develop your query. Additionally, you separate the above three catagories by a `+` sign, and separate multiple conditions per category by a `,`. For example, if I want to query the TOI catalog (`TOI`), and want the TIC ID (`tid`) and corresponding planetary periods (`pl_orbper`) less than 10 days (`pl_orbper < 10`) in a .csv file, I would construct:\n",
    "\n",

    "## [Tools](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/tools.html)\n",
    "The archive hosts some useful tools which can help researchers visualize data, as well as perform cursory analysis. This section aims to briefly cover their basic functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Transit and Ephemeris Service](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TransitView/nph-visibletbls?dataset=transits)\n",
    "Several research areas depend on accurate observations of transiting exoplanets (such as atmospheric characiterization). These observations need to planned precisely so that they occur when the planet is transiting. To aid in this process, the NASA Exoplanet Archive hosts a transit and ephemeris service that uses known planetary periods, telescope locations, and transit epochs to develop transit windows to be used in observation planning. This subsection outlines a simple use case. For the user guide, click the 'User Guide' tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool allows for three main modes of target selection:\n",
    "- **Multiple Targets**: Used in most cases. Can draw ephemerids from existing tables, such as the Composite Planetary Systems table, the TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) table, the Kepler table, etc, or from a custom list of target names.\n",
    "- **Single Target**: Find the ephemerids associated with a single target (i.e. 'TOI 210', 'Kepler 1020') or a single host (i.e. 'Proxima Centauri'). This will return multiple ephemerids if the host has multiple planets.\n",
    "- **User Defined**: If the target of interest is not yet available in the archive, or the archive has not been updated with new findings, you can pass your own set of planetary parameter. NOTE: If you want to use a specific observatory, you will need to pass coodinates of some sort!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observer Location\n",
    "\n",
    "The observer location depends on which instrument you plan to use. This is explanatory, and also allows to put in your own coordinates if you plan to do amateur observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observing Window and Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, if you have a specific time window to make the observation, you can input the observing window of interest to see a list of events that will occur. Additionally, you can query when in the transit you wish to observe, i.e. 0 phase (primary transit), 0.5 phase (secondary transit), or anywhere inbetween. Note that the time window is in Universal Time, so be sure to convert accordingly,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I am interested in determining the effective temperature of WASP-18b, which requires observing the **secondary** transit (also known as an *occultation*), where the brightness of the star-planet sytem dips due to the planet moving behind the star. Say I want to do this using the James Webb Space telescope, and I have time for the month of December, 2024. Here is the query:\n",
    "- **Single Target**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_Ephemerids.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the different colors of the entries, representing the uncertainty confidence for the corresponding ephemerids. We want the most precise option, so we double click on the *ExoFOP-TESS TOI* entry, which automatically fills in the 'User Defined' parameters.\n",
    "- **Observer Location: JWST, Observing Window: Dec. 2024, Phases: Secondary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_Ephermerid2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the rest of the query, including the observatory, time window, and desired phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "Here is the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table](../Graphics/Databases/NEA_Ephermerid_Output.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns selected are some of the relevant observing features, but not all. All available column definitions can be found [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/transit/transit_parameters.html). We note that WASP-18b is viewable nearly every day, consistent with its orbital period. Other important aspects include the 'Transit Duration', 'Event Midpoint' (in this case of the secondary transit), and the 'Propagated Midpoint Uncertainty.' When reviewing your data, these are important parameters to make sure your data is consistent with the known exoplanet parameters."

The most commonly thought of constraint is **an Earth-like planet within its system's habitable zone**.
