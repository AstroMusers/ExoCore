    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Welcome to ExoCore! As part of NASA's [Science Core](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-boosts-open-science-through-innovative-training/), ExoCore empowers the next generation of exoplanet scientists through the deployment of an interactive, web-based curriculum. Organized in modules consisting of Jupyter notebooks, users are guided from the basic tools of exoplanet research (e.g. exoplanet [catalogs](#module-1-exoplanet-catalogs)), all the way through to advanced data reduction methods (e.g. [atmospheric transmission spectroscopy](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/03/Transmission_spectroscopy)). Additionally, if only some modules are of interest, students can pick-and-choose which are most relevant to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why ExoCore?**\n",
    "The past few decades have led to extraordinary growth in the exoplanet research landscape, ushering in countless discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of Earth's place in the universe. This remarkable growth has left little room in developing a 'standard curriculum' both due the frequency of discoveries and the rapid cycling of analysis methods due to improvements in technology and software. Because of this, students wishing to contribute and engage with modern exoplanet routines may feel stranded due to e.g. lack of mentorship or out-of-date resources. ExoCore seeks to circumvent these barriers, so students can begin making meaningful contributions to the field as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Open Science**\n",
    "In brief, [open science](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/) is the philosophy that products of scientific research (e.g. methods, results, analyses) should be freely and reasonably accessible by anyone. Open science is primarily supported by digital platforms that make this dissemination possible. Some key examples of open science are:\n",
    "- Public [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories\n",
    "- Open Access scientific journals\n",
    "- Open source data repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "NASA's [OS 101](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/) is a curriculum that explores the many use cases, nuances, and applicability of open science. It is strongly encouraged for any scientist, aspiring or current!\n",
    "\n",
    "ExoCore is built on the principle of open science, and as such the resources used and cited are all openly available for anyone to use. Additionally, ExoCore guides users on the 'best practices' of open science and how it can be applied to their research in exoplanets, as well as pointers on how they can take advantage of the open science already present in the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the rapid development and progress in the field, exoplanet research could not function without open science. Engagement with open science techniques like e.g. sharing analysis pipelines, disseminating results in open access journals, and universal access to open databases are key factors in the success in the exoplanet community. ExoCore continues this by exposing users to the most commonly used open access tools and resources, as well as informing how they can align their research with the principles of open science."

    "ExoCore comprises seven modules aimed to compartmentalize the different aspects of exoplanet research and the exoplanet community. Each module has several 'lessons' which constitute a self-contained, interactive Jupyter notebook on a particular topic. The modules *do not follow a particular order*. Many lessons can stand alone, and those that do not will have all prerequisites clearly stated. Additionally, some modules will have guided activities or assessments to help internalize the content of the lessons. Links to related, but out-of-scope, content will also be provided for the curious user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some users may be interested in learning a particular analysis method (e.g. the transit method or transmission spectroscopy), that stretch beyond a single lesson but do not require all modules ExoCore. As such, we have compiled some 'sub-curricula' that list and order lessons to achieve a particular goal [here]()."

    "### **Module 5: Data Reduction and Modeling Software**\n",
    "Data reduction is the process of taking a raw data output (e.g. Hubble images) and reducing it down to a few important parameters (e.g. transmission spectra). These reduction pipelines are meant to streamline otherwise intractable processes for an individual wanting to use the most current analysis methods in the field. Despite how useful and time-saving these pipelines are, it is not always obvious to a new user what (or why) routines are being implemented. This can lead to issues in troubleshooting, interpretation in results, and a knowledge gap on how results are derived. This module of ExoCore outlines common data reduction packages, with an emphasis on the transparency of steps being taken to reduce the data. Each lesson will also go through example(s) with real data to help practice each routine.\n",

Each lesson gives a brief history of the structure, deployment, and outcomes for various citizen science programs, as well as other logistical aspects of how citizen science programs are able to run and function.
