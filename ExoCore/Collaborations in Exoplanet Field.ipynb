    "As exoplanet research continues to grow, large working groups of astronomical observers have come together to support the missions set forth by U.S. satellite observatories. The three main collaborations focused on narrowing such missions are TESS-Object of Interest (TOI), TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP), and James Webb Space Telescope Early Release Program (JWST ERS). These collaborations aim to accelerate exoplanet discovery by both supporting exoplanet missions and increasing resource visibility. "

    "The Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS) aims to discover thousands of exoplanets in orbit around the nearest, brightest dwarf stars in the sky. The primary types of exoplanets the TESS project is searching for are Earth-like planets and super-Earths. The TESS Object of Interest (TOI) features a catalog of discoveries which are indentified as an object of interest by the TESS project and community. This catalog is updated approximately once a week according to the ExoFOP-TESS TOI list. As of February 26th of 2024, there are 7,071 objects of interest logged. This list can be found in the [exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_TOI_columns.html#planetpropcol)."

    "Another main goal of TESS is to measure the masses of 50 planets whose radius is samller than 4 Earth radii. TFOP is a collection of observers whose task is to follow up on this set of measurements, as well as following up with TOI's. Stars that maintain high priority planet candidates will be reviewed for their stellar parameters, to confirm the existence of planets, refine their radii, and measure planet masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFOP is overseen by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), along with MIT, in accordance with the TESS Space Office (TSO). The goals of TFOP are to facilitate communication and efficacy within the TESS Science Team and the exoplanet community. This is intended to strengthen scientific knowledge and prevent the duplication of effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFOP consists of five branches: Seeing Limited Photometry, Recon Spectroscopy, High-Resolution Imaging, Precise Radial Velocities, and Space Photometry. Observations will be performed with committed time on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (for photometry and spectroscopy), the MEarth (photometry) and TRES (spectroscopy) observatories, as well as several other provisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within TFOP is a web-based service generated by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), known as ExoFOP. ExoFOP is essential in mediating TFOP ventures, observations, and resources. ExoFOP is a medium through which the community can share data and information on follow-up observations to aid in the efficiency of community telescope resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "ExoFOP offers a dedicated page for TESS, known as ExoFOP-TESS. ExoFOP-TESS currently consists of pages for each of the 10.8 million stars within the TESS Candidate Target list (CTL). These pages hold data from the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) Version 5, including coordinates, magnitudes, stellar parameters, and planet parameters (if available).\n",
