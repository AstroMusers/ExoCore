    "As exoplanet research continues to grow, large working groups of astronomical observers have come together to support the missions set forth by U.S. satellite observatories. The three main collaborations focused on narrowing such missions are TESS-Object of Interest (TOI), TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP), and James Webb Space Telescope Early Release Program (JWST ERS). These collaborations aim to accelerate exoplanet research by both supporting scientific missions and increasing resource visibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing exoplanets consists of several techniques, but the primary tools that researchers use can begin with python scripts that help capture and configure data to demonstrate certain phenomena. For example, some techniques are but are not limited to, light curve data, which provides information about a planets transit, atmospheric properties, architecture, and stellar variablity and activity. This document will feature an overview for each collaborative organization, as well as python code snippets that offer a starting point for accessing and visualizing time-series or catalog-level data in generality. You can modify them to suit your needs and explore additional functionalities offered by the respective data access APIs or libraries. "

    "\n",
    "The Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS) aims to discover thousands of exoplanets in orbit around the nearest, brightest dwarf stars in the sky. The primary types of exoplanets the TESS project is searching for are Earth-like planets and super-Earths. The TESS Object of Interest (TOI) features a catalog of discoveries which are indentified as an object of interest by the TESS project and community. This catalog is updated approximately once a week according to the ExoFOP-TESS TOI list. As of February 26th of 2024, there are 7,071 objects of interest logged. This list can be found in the [exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=TOI)."

    "Another main goal of TESS is to measure the masses of 50 planets whose radius is smaller than 4 Earth radii. TFOP is a collection of observers whose task is to follow up on this set of measurements, as well as following up with TOI's. Stars that maintain high priority planet candidates will be reviewed for their stellar parameters, to confirm the existence of planets, refine their radii, and measure planet masses.\n",

    "TFOP is overseen by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), along with MIT, in accordance with the TESS Space Office (TSO). The goals of TFOP are to facilitate communication and efficacy within the TESS Science Team and the exoplanet community. This is intended to strengthen scientific knowledge and prevent the duplication of effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFOP consists of five branches: Seeing Limited Photometry, Recon Spectroscopy, High-Resolution Imaging, Precise Radial Velocities, and Space Photometry. Observations will be performed with committed time on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (for photometry and spectroscopy), the MEarth (photometry) and TRES (spectroscopy) observatories, as well as several other provisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within TFOP is a web-based service generated by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), known as ExoFOP. ExoFOP is essential in mediating TFOP ventures, observations, and resources. ExoFOP is a medium through which the community can share data and information on follow-up observations to aid in the efficiency of community telescope resources. \n",

    "Collecting data using space observatories can be challening, but the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) consists of high-precision timeseries observations that have induced a steep learning curve for some users. As obervation slots were awarded to researchers in 2018 for JWST Cycle 1, it was (and still is) important that a team of collaborators assist in this transition. \n",

    "The James Webb Space Telescope Early Release Science program (JWST ERS) aims to provide the astronomical community with readily available datasets and analysis toolkits prior to Cycle 2 observations, as well as to assist in collaborations focused on learning how to make the most of JWST for studying exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are three primary objectives of the program:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the spectrophotometric timeseries performance of the key instrument modes on timescales relevant to transits for a representative range of target star brightnesses. We will perform a quantitative assessment of the obtained data quality to inform future instrument and integration/exposure time selections, and shed light on the feasibility of characterizing potentially habitable exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jump-start the process of developing remediation strategies for instrument-specific systematic noise. We will develop open-source data analysis codes that will provide a foundation for establishing the best practices in removing systematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide the community a comprehensive suite of transiting exoplanet data to fully demonstrate JWST's scientific capabilities in this area. We will leverage these data sets to engage the community in an open data challenge that will deepen our understanding and accelerate the diffusion of this knowledge.\n",

    "The program is to perform three scientific and technical investigations that together create six separate observations. These three investigations are known as the Panchromatic Transmission, MIRI Phase Curve, and Bright Star Programs, and the observations utilize five of JWST's spectroscopic modes. The Panchromatic Transmission Program involves four transit observations of a single target with a total of three instruments: NIRISS (one observation with the SOSS mode), NIRSpec (one observation each in the G235H and G395H modes), and NIRCam (one observation in the F322W2 mode). The MIRI Phase Curve Program includes a full-orbit phase curve of a planet using MIRI in the LRS slitless mode. The Bright Star Program is focused on a secondary eclipse observation of a planet orbiting a bright star using NIRISS in the SOSS mode. See Figure 2 for a summary of the observing plan: \n",

    "\n",
    "A community process was established to make the program more efficient. The community process involved open email, message board, and telecon discussions, and democratic voting was used to make decisions. The resulting program is comprehensive in the sense that it takes advantage of the three transiting planet geometries (primary transit, secondary eclipse, and phase curves), covers all of the atmospheric observables (compositions, thermal structures, and dynamics on both the day- and night-sides), and utilizes all four JWST instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is efficient because it includes only the highest priority observations that were set forth by the community process. Other possible observations were considered lower priority due to the ERS goals and thus were released from this program. For example, repeated observations of the same target with the same setup on the near-infrared (NIR) instruments was considered lower priority because we are already observing the same target with all three of the NIR instruments and four unique settings. By requiring a consistent transit shape (modulo the limb darkening) for each observation the cross comparison of these data sets will result in the same test as repeated observations with the same setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The management structure of the Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS program is based on nominal practices dating back to the Kepler mission. It is designed so that the large, distributed, and diverse team can deliver products on time. The PI (person(s) in charge) and co-PIs were peer-elected. A Science Council advises the project leadership and provides mediation for conflict resolution. Altogether, the team offers diversity of expertise (58% observers and 33% theorists, with 9% self-identified as \"other\", which is a category that includes instrumentalists and administrators) and geography (54% US, 46% EU & Canada), with members from research centers, research universities, and smaller undergraduate-focused institutions. Gender balance is 23% women across the team (near the national average for astronomy), and 44% women at leadership levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JWST ERS program is essential in accelerating a comprhensive sensus of transiting exoplanets. By an open data structure, there is a dramatic advance in our understanding of planetary nature, origins, climate, atmospheric physics and chemistry, and habitability. The launch and continued use of JWST will eleveate exoplanet research beyond what we've ever been able to do. With this program, we are on track in achieving such ambitions. "
