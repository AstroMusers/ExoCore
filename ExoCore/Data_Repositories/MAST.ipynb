    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomy is one of the most open sciences regarding access to data repositories, and exoplanetary data is no exception. NASA and other space agencies release the data they've been collecting for decades, leading to massive data sets available online. It's a large universe - it makes sense that the repositories would be similarly significant. While there are a handful of common repositories, each features a unique way to access and handle these critical data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module will give an overview of MAST, its tools, some activities to learn how to access the data, and some responsible practices for larger-scale analysis."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "MAST (the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes) is a NASA-funded data archive focused on near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations. MAST contains data from missions such as the Hubble Telescope, JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), and the Kepler Space Telescope. MAST is also not just a host for data but provides several resources to access and work with their data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access MAST __[here](https://archive.stsci.edu/)__ to explore the site.\n"

    "## Search Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "MAST's numerous search tools are essential to navigating the huge amounts of data available. They all function slightly differently, so be sure to learn the strengths of each one to understand what best suits your research needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAST Portal\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAST Portal is MAST's primary and most comprehensive search engine. You can access the web app __[here](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html)__. The site provides access to a large number of NASA missions, catalogs, and other repositories around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAST Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### exo.MAST\n",
    "\n",
    "__[exo.MAST](https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/)__ is MAST's dedicated exoplanetary data search engine and the most powerful tool for exoplanet analysis. It accesses Kepler, K2, Hubble, TESS, and JWST data sets. These typically include light curves and spectroscopic data. This section will focus on the online portal and provide information regarding the exo. MAST API can be found under the API section. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can search by looking for an individual object of interest or by searching through Exo.MAST's table of atmospheric data. A dropdown menu appears while typing, so if we look for planets around a particular star,  they appear in a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-06-12 140413.png>)\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting a particular planet or object, you will be redirected to a webpage with further information and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to NASA's NEA, Exo.MAST provides primary known data on the left side of the page, including measurements of the star, planet, and system as a whole. On the top, there will be a dropdown menu listing the mission from which this data was sourced and alternative data sources from alternative missions. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-06-12 164033.png>)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the site's value comes from the data visible on the right side. Tabs on the top right control what you see. Typically, you will start on \"Data Coverage,\" where you can click and drag an area to select all data sets relevant for that period and then scroll down to download the datasets themselves and view pertinent information. Multiple observations can be associated with the same point in the planet's period, representing repeated observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Light Curve\" tabs are calibrated light curves from KEPLER or TESS data, and you can explore/interact with the graphs or download the data yourself. It is essential to understand that this is not \"raw\" data. The details of calibration include a number of strategies to process raw data for analysis, including folding, binning, and detrending. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Folding** is the process of stacking several observations of a periodic event (such as an exoplanet transit) and averaging across observations to procure a noiseless observation. This removes random noise that changes over observations and allows for a single light curve analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Binning** is the process of \"binning\" together subsequent data points. For instance, all data points within 5-second periods could be averaged together. This produces a smoother curve and reduces small-scale noise to show large-scale trends in data at the cost of time resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Detrending** is the process of removing trends from a dataset to only show the difference in the data from a particular trend. This removes systematic biases and allows researchers to focus on smaller fluctuations within the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-06-12 164316.png>)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Related Links\" tab allows you to explore any relevant papers already published about your object or explore further analyses of the data measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the \"JWST Visibility\" allows users to plan for a JWST observation. It provides relevant information for an observing session, such as when the target is visible to JWST, signal-to-noise ratios for atmospheric spectroscopy, and links to other helpful sources.\n",

    "\n",
    "MAST offers plenty of tools developed by NASA and community-derived to ease processing and analysis. These range from custom preselected packages of exoplanet data to Python packages to cloud processing, so you don't need to download massive datasets to analyze them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### astroquery.MAST\n",
    "\n",
    "astroquery.MAST allows for easy querying of the MAST Portal through Python. While you can find the detailed documentation __[here](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html)__, this notebook will review the basics of making requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package allows for three main queries: observational data, catalog data, and image data. These are provided by classes that can be imported from the package, such as `Observations` and `Catalogs.` Let's see an example of how to use the `Observations` class for exoplanetary data."
