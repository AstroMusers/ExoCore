    "# Overview\n",
    "The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) is the primary data repository for all space telescope missions, including Hubble, JWST, TESS, and Kepler. Most exoplanet discoveries and analysis are performed using these instruments, so being able to navigate, query, and download data products is imperative. MAST is a **vast** network with countless tools, many of which are out of scope for this curriculum. Consequently, this module covers the following tools:\n",
    "- [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html)\n",
    "- [MAST API via astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html)\n",
    "- [Exoplanet Atmosphere Observability Table](https://catalogs.mast.stsci.edu/eaot/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources that are not discussed, but that may be useful to some users, include:\n",
    "- [TESScut (TESS Full Frame Image Cutout Tool)](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/)\n",
    "- [MAST Search (Hubble and JWST form-based query tool)](https://mast.stsci.edu/search/ui/#/)\n",

    "The MAST Portal is the web-based GUI where data can be easily accessed from. This section will go over how to construct a basic query and will offer pointers to tutorials and user guides for more advanced queries and tools.\n",

    "## Searching for Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Basic Search](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Basic+Search)\n",
    "This comes in two steps:\n",
    "- Select a collection to query\n",
    "- Submitting a valid search criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "![Logo ><](../Graphics/Data_Repositories/MAST_menu_selectCollection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, 'MAST Observations' is a safe default. A [table](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Basic+Search) is available that gives information on the other collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to query an object: by **name** or **coordinates**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search by Name\n",
    "Querying by object is straightforward, and MAST is able to recognize a variety of different inputs for the same target. For example, WASP-100 also goes by TIC 38846515, 2MASS J04355033-6401373, etc., and will result in the same query. Here is a table outlining common paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Logo ><](../Graphics/Data_Repositories/MAST_Allowed.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search by Coordinate\n",
    "RA and DEC can be specified along with a search radius to query a region of the sky. The format of this search is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`RA DEC r=[radius][unit]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `unit` can be \"d\" (degrees), \"min\" (arcminutes), or \"s\" (arc-seconds). RA and DEC units can be in sexadecimal, decimal degrees or galactic coordinates. Below outlines the acceptable formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Logo ><](../Graphics/Data_Repositories/MAST_Allowed_Coord.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### [List Search](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Search+a+List+of+Targets)\n",
    "A list of targets can also be passed as a search.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Logo ><](../Graphics/Data_Repositories/MAST_Target_List.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum required information, in distinct columns, are **Target** and **RA + DEC**, following the same paradigms as the basic search. \n",

    "\n",
    "For our target, we can easily download the TESS time-series data, which would be the second row in the list displayed above (the first is a FFI, or Full Frame Image) by clicking on the \"Save\" icon.\n",
    "\n",
